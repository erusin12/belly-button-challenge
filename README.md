# belly-button-challenge
 Challenge 14
This was challenge 14 which was a project involving a belly button microbe dataset.  The starter code was blank and I struggled with the subject as it appears to be very complex and we lightly scratched the surgface.  Our instructor worked a lot with us and helped create a starter code.  The sample code worked with the dataset and the html index page provided.  

First, a bar chart was created showing the top 10 microbes.  Next there was a bubble chart displaying the data.

I have attempted multiple times to publish this to Github pages.  This is new to our class as we have not been over this.  It is not working correctly, unfortunately.  

This homework was done with the help of office hours and assistance from my instructor.
