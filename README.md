# belly-button-challenge
 Challenge 14
This was challenge 14 which was a project involving a belly button microbe dataset.  The starter code was blank and I struggled with the subject as it appears to be very complex and we lightly scratched the surface on some aspects.  Our instructor worked a lot with us and helped create a starter code.  The sample code worked with the dataset and the html index page provided.  

First, a bar chart was created showing the top 10 microbes.  Next there was a bubble chart displaying the data.  This was published to be an interactive dashboard with data that changes based on selections.

When my repository was completed, I was able to publish this to github pages.

This homework was done with the help of office hours and assistance from my instructor.
